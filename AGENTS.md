# Agent instructions (Plover)

Repository-wide guidance for coding agents. Cursor users: the same rules live in `.cursor/rules/git-workflow-safety.mdc` (local; `.cursor/` is gitignored).

## Git workflow safety

### Commits after work units

When a **plan, user message, or session goal** says to finish with commits (e.g. “의미 단위 커밋”, “작업 단위가 끝나면 커밋”), **commit before ending the turn** — do not leave completed work uncommitted.

Split into **separate commits** when changes belong to different concerns (e.g. UTF-8 recovery vs a new feature).

### Plan execution (auto-commit)

When **implementing an attached Cursor plan** (`.plan.md` with todos — e.g. “Implement the plan as specified”):

- **Commit without a separate “커밋하세요” request** — plan execution is sufficient permission.
- Finish with commits **before ending the turn** when plan todos are done (or at each logical unit if the plan lists “권장 커밋 단위”).
- Follow the plan’s suggested commit splits when present; otherwise split by concern (netlist/sim, decode/tests, units, docs).
- Exclude unrelated dirty files (e.g. fixtures touched by another task) unless the plan covers them.

For work **outside** an active plan, only commit when the user asks or the session goal explicitly requires it.

### Never run without explicit user request

- `git checkout -- .` or `git restore .` on tracked files (especially Korean markdown)
- `git reset --hard`
- Bulk encoding replace on `docs/**/*.md`

### Commit procedure

1. `git status` and `git diff` — confirm scope
2. Stage only files for **one** logical unit
3. Commit with a clear message (why, not a file list)
4. Repeat until the working tree is clean for finished work
5. Run relevant tests before feature commits when applicable

### When unsure

If the user asked for commits in the **same thread or plan**, treat that as permission for those commits. If scope is mixed, **split commits** rather than skipping.

When implementing a **Cursor plan**, commit in-session per **Plan execution (auto-commit)** above — do not defer to a later turn or wait for an extra commit message from the user.

## Document tiers (truth cascade)

When answering **hardware architecture**, **bring-up**, or **decode/CPLD/ALU** questions, edit and cite in this order:

| Tier | Path | Role |
|------|------|------|
| **Root** | [plover-whitepaper.md](plover-whitepaper.md) §6 | ISA / FSM narrative |
| **Reference** | `reference/**` | Normative detail, bring-up, frozen fixtures |
| **Machine** | `simulators/cyclesim/data/isa.py`, `fsm_table.py` | Executable golden |
| **CPLD** | `cpld/tools/` — WinCUPL, OpenOCD, JTAG probe | Toolchain (active); HDL archived |
| **Archive** | `archive/*.tar.gz`, `archive/tier-c-single-cpld/`, `cpld-rev-g-hdl.tar.gz`, `fit-study-gpr-fsm.tar.gz`, `gpr4-regfile-research.tar.gz` | Historical — **do not** cite for SoC unless user asks |

**Anchor docs:** [control-and-decode.md](reference/hardware/control-and-decode.md), [system-architecture.md](reference/hardware/system-architecture.md), [plover-whitepaper.md](plover-whitepaper.md).

**Active hardware truth:** whitepaper root → reference cascade → machine code → CPLD artifacts. **v1.0 normative = Gi1** (R0/AC only, MBR→ALU B, TFR removed, G-IC 1-wire). **rev G** (3-GPR·TFR) is archived — [archive/rev-g-dual-3gpr/README.md](archive/rev-g-dual-3gpr/README.md). Restore guide: [archive/MANIFEST.md](archive/MANIFEST.md).

**Strobe layers:** LUT/csim tests use `reg_we_lut` (Gi1 G-IC is **reg_we only**). Bench/cyclesim merged pin `net_reg_we`. Reference tables describe Gi1 merged behavior.

**MC policy:** ATF1504 **64 macrocell** is a BOM chip rating only. Bring-up gate = WinCUPL **Design fits** — do not record fitter used-MC counts in normative prose.

**Forbidden for SoC / bring-up answers** (unless user asks for history):

- Citing or executing restored content from `archive/*.tar.gz` or restored `cpld/` HDL/fit-study trees
- Treating **`alu8_decode`** as the breadboard decode path
- Flash **`$4000`** control-word burn, **`cpu_cw_direct`**, pareto MC as v1.0 gates

**No feasibility from archived sim** — timing and fit use reference frozen numbers ([alu-opcodes-timing.md](reference/hardware/alu-opcodes-timing.md)) and M2a lab checklist only.

**Do not** implement bring-up or reference edits based on archived tarball content unless the user explicitly requests historical comparison.

**Stale terms** (after 2026-07 Gi1 adoption): `inc_en`, `INC_B_SEL`, `INC_2C2`, `14 IC` for ALU BOM, `b_sel`/`b_const_sel` as SoC signal names (use `net_bctrl0..3`), **`cpld_3fixed` / rev G normative** (use **Gi1** / `cpld_ac_mbr`), **`tfr_valid` / TFR opcodes** as v1.0 (reserved `0x10–0x1F`).
